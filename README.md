# Coding3 Final Project
### Source of the data set
URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/peymannejat/ovarian-cancer-pathology-patches

This dataset contains images associated with human cells. I selected 600 images from this database as the real images. I would like to create works of art related to cells because I believe that the morphology and texture of cells in microstructures have a unique visual effect. These patterns show beauty even though they are made by nature, which is the wonder of life.

### Code reference

The reference code used DCGAN to generate 64x64 and 128x128 color Chinese art images.This author has successfully trained high quality images that show clear landscapes and floral patterns.
